Research and Work Experience
======
* **Integrated Systems Design Automation Research Lab Lab at Amirkabir University of Technology** (October  2019 - Present) <br/>
  * Supervisor: Dr. Morteza Saheb Zamani
  * Provide a parallel algorithm based on cellular automata to accelerate the hydraulic analysis of Water     distribution networks. This method consists of two stages: producing parallel sub-systems and solving the hydraulic model concurrently by using a linearization-based method.
