My name is Ali Soveizi. I want to introduce myself as a master's degree graduate in Computer Architecture from the Amirkabir University of Technology (Ranked 345th in QS World University Rankings by Subject 2021, Engineering & Technology) with a total GPA of 17.30/20. I also completed my undergraduate studies in Computer (Hardware) Engineering at Shahed University of Tehran with a total GPA of 16.30/20 (Last Two Years GPA of 17.72/20). I have enriched my academic experience by publishing a journal article. My masterâ€™s thesis was designing a parallel computational architecture for high-speed hydraulic equations in a cellular automaton. I did some projects in these fields (you can see them in projects).
