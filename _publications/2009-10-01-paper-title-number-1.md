Changing management approach in process migration by Considering process as an abstract element on the target computing node and calculates the impact of the factors affecting the process.Considering the above factors make process migration managerable to create sets of computational node that can be considered as destination computing node.
Using this mechanism allow the process migration management in case of dynamic and interactive nature occurrence in destination able to decide about changing on global activity execution so it is not necessary to recall load balancer manager in order to choose destination computing node. These subject louds to decrease execution time of process migration activity in distributed Exascale computing system.
